# Introduction

## General

Prepare before continue:
- A machine with *virtual machine* ([VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)(recommended)/[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)/[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)/[Hyper V](https://learn.microsoft.com/vi-vn/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v)) or bare metal running Linux distro (`debian` is recommended)
- Knowledge of `C programming`, `compiler`, and `assembly` language (ASM) 

Computer unit:
- `Binary`: including only 0 and 1 (bit), this is machine language
- `Decimal`: from 0 to 9. Basic number in daily life  
- `Hexadecimal`: same as decimal but including A to F

ASCII table:

Standing for `American Standard Code for Information Interchange`. Below is the `ASCII` character table, including descriptions of the first 32 characters. ASCII was originally designed for use with teletypes, and so the descriptions are somewhat obscure, and their use is frequently not as intended, more details at [here](https://www.asciitable.com/)

## Computer architecture

`Central Processing Unit` (CPU) load instructions from memory and execute. Instructions are decided to executed by `Instruction pointer` - a register of `CPU`, used for storing next instruction address. 2 noticeable condition:
- What instructions loaded into memory 
- Instruction pointer has value addresses of above instructions
