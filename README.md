# Introduction

Prepare before continue:
- A machine with *virtual machine* ([VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)(recommended)/[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)/[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)/[Hyper V](https://learn.microsoft.com/vi-vn/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v)) or bare metal running Linux distro (`debian` is recommended)
- Knowledge of `C programming`, `compiler`, and `assembly` language (ASM) 

Computer unit:
- `Binary`: including only 0 and 1 (bit), this is machine language
- `Decimal`: from 0 to 9. Basic number in daily life  
- `Hexadecimal`: same as decimal but including A to F

ASCII table:

Standing for `American Standard Code for Information Interchange`. Below is the `ASCII` character table, including descriptions of the first 32 characters. ASCII was originally designed for use with teletypes, and so the descriptions are somewhat obscure, and their use is frequently not as intended, more details at [here](https://www.asciitable.com/)

## Computer architecture

### CPU

`Central Processing Unit` (CPU) load instructions from memory and execute. Instructions are decided to executed by `Instruction pointer` - a register of `CPU`, used for storing next instruction address. 2 noticeable condition:
- What instructions loaded into memory 
- Instruction pointer has value addresses of above instructions

### Register

a fast memory inside CPU, has same length of the structure CPU (32 bit for Intel 32bit). Some kinds of register:
- `General register`: used for calculating, varriable, parameters (`EAX`, `EBX`, `ECX`, and `EDX`)
- `String handling register`: string actions including copy string or get string length (`EDI`, and `ESI` )
- `Stack register`: managing data stack (`EBP`, and `ESP`)
- `Special register`: including `EIP` (Instruction pointer), and `EFLAGS` contains `1 bit flag`: sign flag, carry flag, zero flag, etc. 
- `Partion register`: managing size of memory (`DS`, `ES`, and `CS`)

### Memory

`Memory` and `Linear address`:
- Using `RAM` to get address of 2 other registers, so computer can get more space with `swap partition`
- `Data bus` and `Address bus` used for transmiting 32-bit data to `CPU` every times
-  `Endianness` is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory. `Little edian` is an order in which the "little end" (least significant value in the sequence) is stored first, help `CPU` know how to get specific bit in 32-bit data

### Machine language

Some definitions:

- `Instructions` are what CPU can do
- `Machine code` is code which is ready to be executed by machine processor
- `Opcode` is code to be executed by an interpreter
- `Assembly language` often referred to simply as Assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming

## Buffer Overflow

Happen when input is too long for limitation of memory. 3 points to take advantage of buffer overflow:
- `Key data` should be behide (at the right side) `Injected data` which can be buffer overflow
- `Injected data` must overflow to `key data` 
- Modified `Key data` must have meaning to execute program
